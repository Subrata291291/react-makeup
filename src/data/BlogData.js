      description: `✨ 1. Minimalist Makeup, Maximum Glow
    Gone are the days of heavy, cakey bridal makeup. The trend now is skin-first beauty — dewy, luminous skin that looks fresh and radiant.

    🎨 2. Bold Eyes & Statement Lashes
    Think metallic eyeshadows, jewel tones, or soft smudged liners paired with dramatic lashes.

    🌿 3. Henna Art with a Modern Twist
    Minimalist, geometric patterns, white henna, and glitter accents are trending.

    👰 4. Statement Hair Accessories
    From pearl-studded pins to floral crowns and metallic clips, bridal hairstyles are being elevated with creative hair accessories. Messy buns and sleek low ponytails remain popular, but the finishing touch is always a stylish statement piece.

    💅 5. Custom Nail Art
    Bridal nails are getting their own spotlight. Soft pastels, nude bases with gold foil, or mehendi-inspired nail art are all in trend. Many brides are now syncing their nails with their outfits or bridal jewelry.

    🌸 6. Skincare Before Makeup
    Brides are investing in bridal skin prep months in advance — facials, derma treatments, and home routines. Glow facials, oxygen therapy, and lymphatic massages are popular choices to get that camera-ready skin.

    📸 7. Pre-Wedding Beauty Trials
To avoid any surprises on the big day, beauty trials are now a must. From hair styling to mehendi design and makeup, brides are doing test runs to find the perfect look that reflects their personality.

Final Thoughts 💕
The modern bride wants to feel confident, radiant, and uniquely herself. Whether you're going for a classic look or trying something bold and new, the key is to stay true to your style while embracing the trends that resonate with you.

      description: `👑 1. Classic Buns with a Twist
Low buns remain a top bridal choice, but now they’re being elevated with braided textures, twisted strands, and subtle volume. Paired with a maang tikka or delicate floral pins, these buns offer a regal yet romantic look.
🌸 2. Fresh Flowers as Hair Jewelry
From jasmine and roses to orchids and baby's breath, fresh flowers are making a comeback as natural, fragrant accessories woven into braids, buns, or even loose curls. They're perfect for both traditional and boho bridal styles.
✨ 3. Soft Curls and Loose Waves
For pre-wedding events or contemporary bridal looks, soft waves or Hollywood curls are in demand. These styles add glamour while keeping the look soft and feminine — ideal for receptions or cocktail nights.
💎 4. Statement Hair Accessories
Pearl-embedded clips, crystal hairbands, and gold-toned combs are replacing the traditional gajras and hair chains. These accessories complement both lehengas and gowns, adding a luxury touch to modern hairstyles.
🌀 5. Braided Magic
Brides are loving intricate braid styles — French braids, fishtails, or waterfall braids — either worn alone or blended with buns and ponytails. Braids add detail and texture, perfect for mehendi or haldi events.
📸 6. Hair Trials are a Must
With endless options, bridal hair trials have become essential. They help you match your hairdo with your face shape, outfit neckline, and veil or dupatta draping style.
💬 Final Word
Your hair is your crown — and on your wedding day, it should make you feel nothing less than royal. Whether you go with a sleek look, voluminous curls, or a detailed bun, choose a hairstyle that makes you feel confident and radiant.

      description: `🌟 1. Soft Shimmers and Champagne Tones
Subtle, light-reflecting shadows in shades of rose gold, champagne, and bronze are taking center stage. They create a romantic, ethereal glow that’s perfect for daytime weddings and outdoor ceremonies.
🔥 2. Smokey Eyes with a Modern Twist
The classic smokey eye is getting a bridal makeover — softer edges, neutral tones, and just a hint of drama. Think taupes, browns, and mauves rather than stark black. Perfect for reception nights or cocktail parties.
🎨 3. Colored Liners & Inner Corner Pops
2025 is embracing pops of color in unexpected places — like a teal or burgundy eyeliner, or a gold shimmer in the inner corner of the eye. These details add flair without overpowering the look.
💎 4. Glitter and Foil Accents
For brides who love a bold, statement look, micro-glitter lids, foil shadows, or pressed pigment highlights give the eyes a sparkling finish that looks incredible in photos.
💃 5. Lash Drama
No eye look is complete without lashes! Fluffy, wispy extensions or well-placed false lashes are essential to define the eyes and enhance their shape. More brides are also using lash lifts and tints for a semi-permanent effect.
✍️ 6. Perfect Brows Frame the Look
Bold, well-groomed brows are still in. Whether you choose a natural arch, feathered brows, or defined tails, your brows should balance your eyes and frame your face effortlessly.
🧴 7. Waterproof is a Must
With all the happy tears, hugging, and dancing, long-wear and waterproof formulas are non-negotiable. Smudge-proof liners and setting sprays keep your eye makeup intact from ‘I do’ to the last dance.
💬 Final Word
Eye makeup is one of the most powerful ways to transform your look. Whether you dream of a soft bridal glow or a high-glam evening look, the right eye makeup will make your gaze unforgettable.

        🌀 1. Minimalist and Modern Designs
Brides are now leaning toward minimalist mehendi styles — clean lines, negative space, and elegant motifs that are stylish yet understated. Perfect for modern brides who want a fresh, fashionable look.
🕊 2. Personalization & Love Stories
One of the most beautiful trends is customized mehendi, where designs include the couple’s initials, wedding dates, or even miniature illustrations of their story — like a first meet or proposal. It’s meaningful, artistic, and deeply personal.
🕌 3. Traditional Meets Contemporary
From Rajasthani and Marwari patterns to Arabic and Indo-Western fusion styles, today’s brides are blending heritage with creativity. Think peacocks, paisleys, lotus motifs — all tied together with modern symmetry.
✨ 4. Mehendi for Every Event
Bridal mehendi is no longer just for the wedding day. Light, stylish patterns are now common for pre-wedding shoots, sangeet nights, and even haldi ceremonies — keeping the look fun and photogenic.
💫 5. White and Glitter Mehendi
For brides who love experimenting, white henna and glitter mehendi are the new stars. Ideal for themed parties or western outfits, these styles are non-traditional but make a bold statement.
🖌 6. Full Hand vs. Minimal Backhand
While full-hand traditional mehendi still rules the wedding day, more brides are choosing simpler backhand patterns with focus only on the fingers or wrist, creating balance and elegance.
📸 7. Mehendi Moments Matter
The mehendi application itself has become a cherished ritual. With music, photos, floral décor, and laughter, this intimate event sets the tone for the celebrations ahead.
💬 Final Word
Mehendi is more than just decoration — it’s an expression of love, tradition, and identity. Whether you dream of intricate motifs or a modern minimalist design, your bridal mehendi should reflect who you are.
